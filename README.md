Yet another simple chat app

## Getting Started

This app used **[supabase](https://supabase.io/)** for authentication and database. So, you need to create a project,
then get the ```API URL``` and ```API Key``` by yourself. Place those two values on ```.env``` file (create if you don't
have one), and name it ```API_URL``` and ```ANON_KEY``` (or change the name whatever you want). And you're ready to go!
